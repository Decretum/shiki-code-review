In this src folder, there are three folders:
> review
> fix
> complete
These three folders represent the life cycle of your code.

When you finish a practice problem, create a Java file for it in the "review" folder.
Don't forget to push your project as well.
When I get a chance, I will review it, add some comments, and put it in the "fix" folder.
That's for you to look at my comments and fix your code.
Alternatively, if it doesn't have any issues as is, I'll move it to the "complete" folder.
Once you're done fixing your code, put it back in the "review" folder.
I'll look at your code again and if I think it's fine I'll move it to the "complete" folder.
Or maybe I'll move it back to the "fix" folder with more comments if I feel like it can still be improved.
